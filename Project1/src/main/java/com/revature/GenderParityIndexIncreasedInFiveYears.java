/**
 * 
 * This job looks at tertiary enrollment rates for men versus women using the Gender Parity Index.
 * A GPI of less than 1 means men outnumber women, greater than 1 means women outnumber men, 1 means their equal.
 * 
 * We'll be focusing on countries whose GPI have risen within the five most recent years between 2010 and 2016.
 * 		where women are outnumbered in tertiary education.
 * 
 * Finding countries whose GPI has risen within the the five most recent years might have "special programs
 *		aimed at women" that positively impact womens' involvement in higher education.
